            <h1>The Never-Ending Sum</h1>
            <p>This is a simple game to pass some time.</p>
            <p>It was made by <a href="http://somethingorotherwhatever.com">Christian Lawson-Perfect</a> while on strike.</p>

            <p>Use the free text area under each sum to do your working-out.</p>

            <p>There are no scores or things to unlock - just do as many sums as you like.</p>
            <p>Your progress gets saved automatically, so when you've had enough feel free to close the page, and come back to it whenever you feel like doing more sums.</p>

            <p>If you've got ideas for sums that could go in the game, please <a href="https://github.com/christianp/the-neverending-sum/issues">add an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>It'll probably break if you set the difficulty too high. Think about that.</p>
